# Hackers

Hackers is an iPhone app for reading Hacker News on the go. It's optimised for quickly catching up on the latest news and comments without getting in your way.

## Features

* Comments replies are collapsed, leaving you to decide whether you want to read the replies without them getting in the way.
* Remembers which posts you've read.
* Read top news, new news, or Ask HN.
* Instapaper mobilizer support.
* Save links to Instapaper and Pinboard
* Dark and light themes

## Open Source

Hackers is open source and licenced under the MIT licence. Feel free to build and install it on your own iPhone. If you'd like to support me, the developer, you can buy Hackers in the app store for $1.99 (Â£1.49).
